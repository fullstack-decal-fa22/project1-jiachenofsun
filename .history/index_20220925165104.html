    <h2>Fictional Character Biography</h2>

    <h3>Season 1</h3>
    <p>Steve is initially portrayed as a stereotypical 1980s popular jock, antagonistic and unlikable. Steve had been
        dating Nancy Wheeler but after he harasses Jonathan Byers by breaking his camera, Nancy seems to become close to
        Jonathan. Steve accosts Jonathan, but Jonathan beats him in a fight and Steve sees the error of his ways and
        ignores his former "friends". Traveling to the Byers' home to apologize, he becomes involved in Nancy and
        Jonathan's fight against the Demogorgon, which they defeat. At the conclusion of the season, Nancy buys Jonathan
        a new camera and Steve continues his relationship with Nancy.

    <h3>Season 2</h3>
    <p>
        Steve's relationship with Nancy is stressed, and he breaks up with her after she will not say she loves him. He
        calls her out after her drunken tirade at a party where she calls their relationship fake. Steve also finds
        himself at odds with Billy Hargrove, a new student at the school who seeks to become its tough guy. Steve
        becomes involved with Mike Wheeler and his friends after Dustin asks him to help find his "pet" D'Artagnan,
        unaware it is a Demodog. Steve and Dustin bond over how to talk to girls, and soon Steve also takes Mike, Lucas,
        and Max (Billy's step-sister) under his wing. Steve protects the children as Demodogs start ravaging across
        Hawkins, giving time for Eleven and Jim Hopper to close the gate to the Upside Down, and for Will Byers to have
        the Mind Flayer exorcised from his body. He also defends the kids against Billy, and is knocked unconscious
        before Max is able to disable her brother.</p>
